  <p>As an AI Engineer and PhD Researcher, I specialize in computer vision, generative AI, and their practical applications. My expertise spans <strong>over seven years</strong> of academic and project-based experience, focusing on developing intelligent systems that solve complex, real-world problems.</p>

  <p>I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at UiT The Arctic University of Norway and 
  <a href="https://simulamet.no" target="_blank">SimulaMet</a>. My doctoral research broadly explored the development of AI-driven virtual avatars for training professionals in sensitive human-AI interaction scenarios, leveraging advanced techniques in 3D avatar generation. Prior to this, my M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis from Razi University allowed me to apply AI directly to medical image analysis.</p>

  <p>My background includes contributing to  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Y4lkuwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> 15 peer-reviewed articles </a> in international journals and workshops. I am a detail-oriented, highly motivated, and adaptable professional, always eager to learn and implement new tools and methods to achieve impactful results.</p>

  <p>Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and professional experience. I'm always open to collaboration and curious conversationsâ€”get in touch!</p>

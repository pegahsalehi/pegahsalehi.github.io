I’m **Pegah Salehi**, an AI engineer and PhD researcher specializing in **computer vision**, **generative AI**, and **medical image analysis**. With over **seven years of academic and industry experience**, I design intelligent systems that blend cutting-edge machine learning with practical real-world applications.

Currently, I’m completing my PhD at **Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering (SimulaMet)** in Oslo, where my research focuses on creating emotionally expressive **AI-driven avatars** for training professionals in sensitive, high-stakes environments. My work spans **3D avatar generation**, **speech processing**, **dialogue modeling**, and **user interaction**—bridging disciplines to push the boundaries of human–AI interaction.

I’ve collaborated with startups, published across top journals (IEEE, ACM, Scientific Reports), and built systems that are as technically robust as they are ethically mindful.

Feel free to explore my **projects**, **publications**, and **professional experience**. I’m always open to collaboration and curious conversations—get in touch!
